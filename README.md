# Weather_Forecast_Monitoring

The Weather Forecast Monitoring project using deep learning involves developing a model to predict weather parameters based on historical weather data. This project utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, built with Keras, a deep learning library in Python.

1. Objective
The goal is to create a weather forecasting system that predicts weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions using deep learning techniques without relying on APIs. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical weather data.

2. Why Use RNN and LSTM?
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are well-suited for time-series data because they can capture temporal dependencies, making them effective for sequential data like weather conditions.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are an extension of RNNs designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs maintain long-term dependencies, allowing them to learn patterns over extended sequences, which is important for weather prediction.

3. Dataset Preparation
The dataset typically includes weather parameters such as:
Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed
Weather Condition (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy)

The dataset should have these features recorded over a specific time interval (e.g., hourly or daily data for multiple years). Data preprocessing steps include:
Handling missing values
Normalizing features to scale them between 0 and 1
Converting categorical data (e.g., weather condition) to numerical format if necessary.

4. Model Architecture
The LSTM model is designed with:

Input Layer: Accepts the time-series data (e.g., past weather conditions).
LSTM Layers: One or more layers to capture temporal dependencies and learn patterns from past weather data.
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer to map the LSTM output to the final forecasted values.
Output Layer: Outputs predicted weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

5. Training the Model
The model is trained on sequences of weather data using the past 'n' time steps to predict future values.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used for regression tasks like predicting numerical weather parameters.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is frequently used for training deep learning models.

6. Evaluation and Prediction
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The trained model can then predict future weather conditions based on new input sequences, such as temperature and humidity data for the last few days.


7. Deployment
The model can be deployed as part of a real-time weather monitoring system, where users input area names or city details. The system provides the weather forecast based on the trained LSTM model, helping users access localized weather predictions.
